===============

The code with assignments for the Stanford's online Algorithms class

Every implementaion class has a comment block at the top detailing the problem and notes on the solution

Following are the algorithms implemented
1) Merge Sort
2) Quick Sort with three partitioning strategies
3) Minimum Cut of an undirected Graph
4) Algorithm to compute Strongly Connected Components of a Directed Graph
5) Implementation of Dijkstra's Algorithm
6) Two-Sum problem and the algorithm for the Median Maintenance problem using two heaps (one max heap and one min heap)
